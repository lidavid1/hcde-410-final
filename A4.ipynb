    "        For my project I will aim to work with COVID data, attempting to use vaccination rates, cases, deaths, etc. to understand which areas were hit the hardest and why. By looking at what resources were provided (also comparing the resources of what is realistically available in their respective countries) I will aim to gain an understanding of how all of these factors have contributed towards the mission to defeat COVID and use graphs/visulizations to depict the data but also hopefully creating a way to predict how things will turn out given the data and patterns. \n",

    "As COVID is truly not over I want to contribute and gain a stronger understanding of COVID and the areas that are currently being overshadowed/lacked by society. I want to acknowledge the possibilities that there are underlaying factors that are contributing to COVID and bring them to light by cross comparing the data and using the information to predict future COVID trends and potentially prevent them.\n",

    "1. Research Question: Given the timeline of COVID-19, what is the relationships between how society responded to the pandemic and the success of each program? Did one program have a strong/weaker cause on other programs? Was one program more progressive or suppressive towards the pandmic? The goal is to understand how each event affects each other, were they more or less successful and what their relationships were.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Background: After some background research I found that each country responded to COVID-19 with the same series of events (canceling public events, debt relief, etc) but each country had varying levels of success. This begs the research question, how are each of these events relating and affecting each other and the pandemic?\n",
