    "Project Abstract: \n",
    "        For my project I will aim to work with COVID data, attempting to use vaccination rates, cases, deaths, etc. to understand which areas were hit the hardest and why. By looking at what resources were provided (also comparing the resources of what is realistically available in their respective countries) I will aim to gain an understanding of how all of these factors have contributed towards the mission to defeat COVID and use graphs/visulizations to depict the data but also hopefully creating a way to predict how things will turn out given the data and patterns. \n",

    "As COVID is truly not over I want to contribute and gain a stronger understanding of COVID and the areas that are currently being overshadowed/lacked by society. I want to acknowledge the possibilities that there are underlaying factors that are contributing to COVID and bring them to light by cross comparing the data and using the information to predict future COVID trends and potentially prevent them.\n",

    "2. Background: After some background research I have discovered that communities around the United States were all affected on varying levels of magnitude by COVID-19, some communities were more adaptable and handled COVID-19 related issues better and some were hit the hardest with no real help or plan. I want to understand why is this the case while drawing cross comparisons in the data between other COVID-19 metrics and figure out which areas were the largest contributing factors in the lack of adaptability towards the pandemic. \n",
