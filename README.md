# hcde-410-final

Project Abstract: 
        For my project I will aim to work with COVID data, attempting to use vaccination rates, cases, deaths, etc. to understand which areas were hit the hardest and why. By looking at what resources were provided (also comparing the resources of what is realistically available in their respective countries) I will aim to gain an understanding of how all of these factors have contributed towards the mission to defeat COVID and use graphs/visulizations to depict the data but also hopefully creating a way to predict how things will turn out given the data and patterns. 


Motivations: 

As COVID is truly not over I want to contribute and gain a stronger understanding of COVID and the areas that are currently being overshadowed/lacked by society. I want to acknowledge the possibilities that there are underlaying factors that are contributing to COVID and bring them to light by cross comparing the data and using the information to predict future COVID trends and potentially prevent them.
        
Data:

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus provides all COVID related data
https://datahub.io/core/gdp Country GDP and API
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/washington-covid-cases.html COVID trends for any specific state (currently Washington selected)

Unknowns:

Narrowing the scope potentially - focusing on one community, ethnic group, location in the world might yield more consistent data
Accurate population representation 
Representing marginalized communities or individuals
Everything is generalized
